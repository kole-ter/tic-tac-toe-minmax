<h2>Minimax Algorithm</h2>

The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games, such as tic-tac-toe, checkers, chess and go. It is a recursive algorithm that evaluates all possible moves and outcomes within the game state tree, and selects the next best possible move for the AI.
